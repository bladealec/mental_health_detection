## Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks designed for the analysis of a depression dataset. The notebooks include exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques to understand and predict depression states.

### Files:
1. `dataset_eda.ipynb`: Conducts exploratory data analysis on the depression dataset.
2. `pca_kmeans_randomforest_depression.ipynb`: Applies PCA, KMeans clustering, and Random Forest classification to the dataset (Note: This notebook is not finished due to ongoing work on a missing values issue).

## dataset_eda.ipynb
**Purpose**: Perform EDA to understand the distribution and relationships within the depression dataset.

**Key Features**:
- Visualization of depression states distribution.
- Correlation matrix of symptoms.
- Boxplots for each symptom by depression state.
- Pairplot for pairwise symptom relationships.

## pca_kmeans_randomforest_depression.ipynb
**Purpose**: Perform dimensionality reduction, clustering, and predictive modeling on the depression dataset.

**Key Features**:
- PCA for symptom dimensionality reduction.
- KMeans clustering of symptoms.
- Random Forest classification for predicting depression states.
- Evaluation of model performance using classification report and confusion matrix.
